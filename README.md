Insights
•	The company achieved high completion rates (over 85% for each) across all three primary KPIs: Sales, Profit, and Customer. This demonstrated strong execution, yet narrowly missed all set targets.

•	2022 sales exceeded 2021 sales in 11 out of 12 months. Both years demonstrated a significant low season between May and August. However, the 2021 sales increase in May, which kept flat in 2022, is a point of concern for 2023 planning. The strongest growth was achieved in Q4 (9.2% increase over 2021), signaling highly effective year-end campaigns.

•	Sales are highly concentrated in the top three markets: Argentina, Colombia, and Brazil, which collectively account for 76.3% of total revenue. Chile ($253.6M) remains the smallest revenue market.

•	While Quality and Availability are excellent, Speed and Service scores are unacceptable (53%-54%). This suggests the primary friction point is transaction time and staff interaction, not the product itself.

Actionable Recommendations
•	Targeted Low-Season Strategy: Develop a specialized promotional or product launch plan for the May–August period to flatten the systemic sales dip. A 5% increase in these four months would close a significant portion of the $456M target gap. 

•	Urgent Operational Fix for Service: Concerned teams must take urgent action to address the Speed (54%) and Service (53%) failures. The recommended action is to invest in technology (e.g., streamlined ordering app, self-service) or increase staffing during peak hours to specifically reduce customer wait times. A small improvement here could boost customer volume and loyalty.

•	Geographic Strategy Review: Analyze the Service/Speed scores (53%-54%) segmented by the top three revenue-generating countries (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia). Determine if the problems are centralized in one market or are universal, and tailor operational investment based on this regional breakdown.
