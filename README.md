#Insights
•	Operational Risk: Speed (54%) and Service (53%) scores are critically low. This is an execution failure, not a product failure (Quality is 95%).
•	Sales Gap: All three KPIs (Sales, Profit, Customers) missed targets, leaving a $456 million Sales gap (85% completion rate).
•	Growth & Seasonality: 2022 sales outperformed 2021 in Q4 by 9.2%, but a systemic sales dip occurs every year between May and August.
•	Geographic Focus: Sales are highly concentrated in Argentina, Colombia, and Brazil (76.3% of revenue) 

#Actionable Recommendations
•	Urgent Fix: Invest in technology and staffing to reduce wait times and improve service scores, which will directly impact customer volume and loyalty.
•	Focus: Allocate resources to close the largest gap. Revenue growth must now outpace cost control.
•	Strategy: Develop a targeted promotional campaign specifically for the May–August low season to stabilize mid-year revenue and achieve the annual target.
•	Review: Analyze the low Service/Speed scores within these top three markets to prioritize operational fixes where the revenue impact will be greatest.
